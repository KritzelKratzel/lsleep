# lsleep: Lua Sleep with CMake Support
Because sometimes, you just want sleep.


## Introduction

**lsleep** is an uber-simple library that just adds `sleep` and `usleep` to Lua. There is no need anymore to require `luasocket` for this missing feature in Lua.

## Usage

```lua
local lsleep = require 'lsleep'
lsleep(3) -- wait three seconds. Argument must be integer.

local sleep  = lsleep.sleep
local usleep = lsleep.usleep

sleep(1) -- wait one second.
usleep(2.5 * 1000000) -- wait 25_000_000 Âµs (2.5 seconds)
```

**Note:** Original documentation for `lsleep:usleep (wait)` is somewhat erroneous. Argument `wait` counts in microseconds and not in units of 100 nanoseconds.

## Building and Installing lsleep

### Prerequisites

lsleep with CMake Support relies on an installation of [Lua with CMake Support](https://github.com/KritzelKratzel/lua#readme). The same toolchain which has been used with *Lua with CMake Support* is required. lsleep gets all necessary path, header and library information from CMake `liblua` package data and will be installed automatically into the right directory locations - no hassle with `package.path` settings anymore.

### Build and Install

Open `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022` and change drive and directory. Download and unpack sources or simply clone this repository:

```cmd
c:
cd c:\Temp
git clone https://github.com/KritzelKratzel/lsleep
cd lsleep
```

CMake strongly encourages out-of-source builds.

```cmd
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A <arch>
cmake --build . --config Release
cmake --install . --config Release
```

Replace `<arch>` with your desired architecture. Available architectures with selected `Visual Studio 17 2022` generator are `Win32`, `x64`, `ARM` and `ARM64`. lsleep documentation is available in `<lua_install_dir>/share/doc/lsleep` after install.
